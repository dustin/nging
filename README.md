# nging

nging is my old home web server.

I'd been using nginx for a while, but a debian update caused it to
stop working.  At some point, it was easier for me to write a new web
server from scratch than to keep nginx updated.

I'm not using this currently (no computer running to run it on), but
it's got a bunch of useful bits I've used as reference to help other
people know how to do things.
